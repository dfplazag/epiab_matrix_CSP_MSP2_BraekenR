# epiab_matrix_CSP_MSP2_BraekenR
Galaxy workflow that digests any multi-FASTA of Plasmodium falciparum CSP or MSP2 variants into sliding 13-mer peptides (12-aa overlap), tallies peptide counts per variant, and delivers a tabular epitope-abundance matrix ready for heat-map clustering; output integrates smoothly with GeneCluster or R for downstream analyses.
